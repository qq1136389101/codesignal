/**
 * Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighboring, too).
 *
 * Given n and firstNumber, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.
 *
 * Example
 *
 * For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
 * circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.
 *
 * Input/Output
 *
 *     [execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
 *
 *     [input] integer n
 *
 *     A positive even integer.
 *
 *     Guaranteed constraints:
 *     4 ≤ n ≤ 20.
 *
 *     [input] integer firstNumber
 *
 *     Guaranteed constraints:
 *     0 ≤ firstNumber ≤ n - 1.
 *
 *     [output] integer
